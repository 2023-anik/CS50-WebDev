Welcome to my CS50 Web Development practice repository! This repository contains a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that I've developed as part of my journey to learn and master web development.

## About the Repository

This repository is a place for me to experiment, practice, and refine my web development skills. The code here includes:

- **HTML**: Structure and content creation for web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout techniques to make web pages visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity to enhance user experience.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to different topics, projects, or exercises. Each folder may contain:
